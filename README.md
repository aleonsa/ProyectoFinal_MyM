# Final Project: Two Wheeled Inverted Pendulum (TWIP) with PID Controller

This final project was developed as part of the Microprocessors and Microcontrollers course. It aims to implement a control system for a Two Wheeled Inverted Pendulum (TWIP) using a PID controller.

## Project Description

The Two Wheeled Inverted Pendulum (TWIP) is a control system designed to balance an inverted pendulum on two wheels. The objective of this project is to develop a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller to maintain the pendulum in an upright position and achieve stable balance during operation.
